# Stack Read

Track your reading progress on Stackoverflow

## Motivation

On websites like Stackoverflow we usually go there to find solutions for a problem we are currently facing, thats tottaly fine, But for the purpose of learning, Stackoverflow can also act as a huge handy book of others' experiences, mistakes and solutions to the most common developers' problems that can show up on your way later. A good practise for a developer is to read questions and their answers regularly on stack overflow and take his own notes/comments hightlighting what he learns just as if he is reading a book. 

However due to the huge number of questions/answers its hard to keep track of which questions you have read so far, and it would be handy if there is a way to know what is new for you to read and what is not. 

This app helps you keep track of the questions you have read so far on Stackoverflow to avoid reading the same question twice. And you will also be able to share your progress with others, letting them know what you have learned so far and hightlighting the most important questions.
